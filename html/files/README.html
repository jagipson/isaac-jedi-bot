      <h1>The RuBot Project</h1>
<p>
This is an IRC Bot implemented in Ruby using Harry Vangberg&#8217;s
excellent isaac library available at <a
href="http://github.com/ichverstehe/isaac.">github.com/ichverstehe/isaac.</a>
Where isaac is a library for creating an IRC BOT, this project implements
the library to create one.
</p>
<p>
The repository name is just a nod to a classic movie franchise. This bot
cannot destroy the Deathstar.
</p>
<h2>Technical introduction</h2>
<p>
If you aren&#8217;t a Ruby hacker, or just want to use this system, you
probably don&#8217;t need to read this section. If you want to know
generally how it&#8217;s done, then read on.
</p>
<pre>
 *ConfigurationModule.rb* is a utility resource that defines some top-level
</pre>
<p>
methods that users of the system probably don&#8217;t need to know about
and it sets up the environment. Much of the stuff that makes RuBot its own
project has been placed in this file, to keep <b>RubOt.rb</b> as clean as
possible, so that users who have created other <tt>Isaac::Bot</tt>s can
move some of their code into it. Among these utilities are configuration
file reading and writing, and the <tt>BotExtensions</tt> module that is
used to <em>extend</em> our Isaac::Bot instance.
</p>
<p>
The configuration file is stored on disk as a YAML file. The best way to
create a configuration file is to run <b>RubOt.rb</b> without one, and a
new one will be generated. Edit the file (jedbotconf.yaml) using a text
editor, and relaunch RuBot. We dislike global variables, so we stuff all
the global system configuration into the <tt>BOT_CONFIG</tt> Global
Constant hash. As a plugin author, the two that are most meaningful are
<tt>BOT_CONFIG[:owner_nick]</tt> and BOT_CONFIG[:bot_nick].
</p>
<p>
This project <em>extends</em> Isaac::Bot, only minimally.
<tt>Isaac::Bot</tt> stores <tt>Proc</tt> objects in an <tt>@event[]</tt>
data structure using the <tt>on</tt> method. It has no mechanism for
removing the routines, so I have extended it to add an <tt>off</tt> method.
This manipulation of the events data structure is what makes it possible to
add plugin loading and unloading.
</p>
<p>
The remaining functionality is added to the bot either through adding
<tt>on <em>:event</em></tt> Isaac DSL blocks at the bottom of
<b>RuBot.rb</b> (doing things the Isaac way), or by creating subclasses of
<b>PluginBase</b> to create loadable plugins (the RubOt way). Note, that
the <a href="../classes/Core.html">Core</a> plugin contains the
functionality to load and unload modules, and so it is instantiated
differently from any other modules. <b>PluginBase</b> is too complicated to
explain in a readme. We intend to provide documentation for it in the
source, however, in the &#8220;Creating a Plugin&#8221; section, we explain
how to use it.
</p>
<h2>Creating a Bot</h2>
<p>
To personalize RuBot, or to start over, first locate your configuration
file (<tt>jedbotcnf.yaml</tt> is the default one) and delete it or move it
aside. Next run <tt>$ ruby <em>path/to/</em>RubOt.rb</tt>. It will detect
that you have no configuration and build a file for you. Now, edit
<tt>jedbotcnf.yaml</tt> with your IRC settings, an relaunch RuBot.
</p>
<p>
If it&#8217;s working, then you should see <tt>Connected.</tt> in the
terminal. Your bot is now logged in. The <b>Core</b> plugin is controlled
using the *!do* token. In IRC, send <tt>/msg <em>&lt;YourBotName&gt;</em>
!do help</tt> for quick help.
</p>
<p>
One other hint: Sometimes, the help you get with the <tt>help</tt> command
will be different depending on if you are asking for help in a channel, or
a private chat.
